# FreES
A stab at making a free, open source equation solving program.

# Objectives
Quickly solve a set of equations based on a collection of input variables:
- Solve equations iteratively to high accuracy
- Allow use of common constant values in science and engineering from a library of values
- Allow use of conversion factors between different sets of units
- Be presentable and easy to pick up for less code/cli-savvy users
- Be easy to modify/build onto by engineers and scientists (Use TKinter, Python, JSON with good practice.)

This is still very much a WIP.
