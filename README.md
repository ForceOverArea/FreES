# FrEES
A stab at making a free, open source equation solving program.

# Objectives
Quickly solve a set of equations based on a collection of input values. 
- Solve systems of algebraically solved equations
- Solve equations iteratively when algebraic solutions are difficult/impractical
- Allow use of common constant values in science and engineering from a library of values
- Allow use of conversion factors between different sets of units
- Be presentable and easy to pick up for less code/cli-savvy users
- Be easy to modify/build onto by engineers and scientists (Uses TKinter, Python, JSON)
